</p>
<p>
I then went to the tickets tab. There are 2 open tickets. I began triage by prioritizing Karen's ticket due to Organization-defined Policies/ SLA, perceived business impact, and ticket age.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Based on Karen's post. I assigned the ticket to myself, updated the SLA to C, and changed the help topic to Personal Computer Issues from Business Critical Outage

</p>
<p>
I called Karen to gather more information. By asking questions, I was able to analyze the issue more effectively. I was also able to arrange a pickup to begin hands-on diagnostics and repairs.

<p>
Below is the step-by-step diagnostic procedure I used to determine whether the screen was damaged or the integrated graphics chip was damaged. The result was a damaged LCD.

</p>
<p>
To begin the repair, I had to determine the make and model of the laptop. After I  checked if we had replacement LCDs available or if I had to order them. Lucky we had replacements on site.

</p>
<p>
Below is step-by-step instructions on locating where the make and model sticker is located and the box where I found the replacement laptop with the LCD.

</p>
<p>
I continued updating the ticket by posting the repair process and stating that it was successfully completed. I delivered the working laptop and power adapter back to Karen. She confirmed the laptop booted and the screen was fixed.
